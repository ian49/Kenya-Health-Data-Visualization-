# Kenya-Health-Data-Visualization-
This projects introduces  the trends in Kenyas health sector and a demonstration of new data visualization skills learnt

Part of the Data Skills is the ability to explore datasets with impressive and appealing data visualisation.
I use the Kenya health data to build visualisations that provide a more nuanced exploratory analysis of the Kenya health
sector using the *R* programming language via the **ggplot2** package.
